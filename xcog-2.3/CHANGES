Version    Date          Notes
------------------------------------
2.3        Feb 10, 1999  Added C-grid topology to the hyperbolic grid generator. A few 
                         variables have been added to the overlapping grid files (ASCII
                         and HDF) to distinguish the C-topology from normal grids. See
                         the documentation for details.     

2.2        Nov 25, 1998  The installation procedure has been re-worked completely. An 
                         installation script has been added to take care of the machine
                         dependent settings of the makefiles. Pre-compiled executables
                         are also provided to further simplify the installation procedure
                         on some common architectures. The functionality of the program
                         has been improved by allowing grids to grow out in both 
                         directions from a curve in the hyperbolic mapping. It is now
                         also possible to project a side of a hyperbolic grid onto a 
                         curve.

2.1b      Sept 29, 1998  The drawing of a title caused the program to crash on SUN's
                         running Solaris 2.x when the native compiler (cc) was used
                         to make the program. A compiler directive has been added to
                         avoid this problem, at the price of having no titles on the
                         plots.

2.1a        Jul 2, 1998  Fixed a little bug that made the command interpreter crash
                         on some Linux systems. Also changed the compressed tar-
                         file with the source code so that the code will be un-
                         packed in a new directory `xcog-2.1a'.

2.1        May 22, 1998  The major improvement of this version is the addition of a 
                         "hyperbolic" mapping that allows the user to construct a 
                         component grid starting from a curve and growing in the 
                         direction normal to the curve. This mapping is more flexible 
                         than the existing normal-curve mapping, since the transverse 
                         grid lines are allowed to bend. This mapping is therefore 
                         smoother than the normal-curve mapping and it can also be 
                         made thicker close to concave corners.
