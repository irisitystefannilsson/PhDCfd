Purpose:     This software package provides data import modules for the OpenDX
             visualization toolkit (in the src/ subdirectory) which can read
             Cactus output data in HDF5 file format into an OpenDX network.

             For a demonstration of how to use the data import modules, this
             package also provides some example visualization networks (in net/)
             along with a sample Cactus HDF5 output file of a WaveToy binary
             source evolution (in data/).

             For more information on how to visualize Cactus output with OpenDX
             please refer to the Cactus online documentation at

                   http://www.cactuscode.org/VizTools/OpenDX.html

The OpenDXutils modules are dynamically loaded into the OpenDX server program by telling it where to find the runtime-loadable module file and the corresponding module description file. This is done by either invoking OpenDX via:

  dx -mdf  <my_VizTools_dir>/OpenDXutils/src/ImportHDF5.mdf \
     -modules  <my_VizTools_dir>/OpenDXutils/src            \
     [ any other options to OpenDX ]

or, more easily, by setting the following two environment variables in your shell startup file:

  # for csh/tcsh
  setenv DXMODULES  <my_VizTools_dir>/OpenDXutils/src
  setenv DXMDF      <my_VizTools_dir>/OpenDXutils/src/ImportHDF5.mdf

  # for bash
  DXMODULES=<my_VizTools_dir>/OpenDXutils/src
  DXMDF=<my_VizTools_dir>/OpenDXutils/src/ImportHDF5.mdf
  export DXMODULES
  export DXMDF
